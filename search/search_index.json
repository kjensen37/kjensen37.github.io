Although it is the most expensive of the three, the use of I2C will be beneficial aswell as the accuracy and a 12-bit resolution. I believe that the ease of use aswell as the accuracy are enough for me to choose it even with the cost difference.</p> <p>3.3 Volt Switching Regulator</p> <ol> <li> <p>IC REG BUCK 3.3V 1.5A SOT23-5 - SC189ZSKTRT</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>$0.86/each</li> <li>link to product</li> </ul> Pros Cons High efficiency step-down design Limited output current Small footprint Fixed output only Wide input range No advanced features </li> <li> <p>IC REG BOOST ADJ 980MA SOT23-6 - TLV61046ADBVR</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>$1.24/each</li> <li>link to product</li> </ul> Pros Cons Boost capability Not a true linear regulator Integrated protections Boost only Isolation in shutdown Current limits dependent on configuration </li> <li> <p>IC REG BUCK 3.3V 2A TSOT23-6 - AP63203WU-7</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>$0.71/each</li> <li>link to product</li> </ul> Pros Cons Higher output current (2 A) Fixed output Wide input range Requires external inductors/caps EMI-friendly design Higher complexity vs LDO </li> </ol> <p>Rationale: The voltage regulator I am choosing is #1, the SC189ZSKTRT.
