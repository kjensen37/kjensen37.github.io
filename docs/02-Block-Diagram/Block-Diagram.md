## Overview
Below is the block diagram for my subsystem for Team 201. My diagram contains an ESP32, a temperature sensor, and debugging LEDs. Information and power are distributed between team members in the daisy chain format. The board will receive power through a barrel jack or another team members board which is all regulated by a 3.3V power switching supply. The connectors have a wire decdicated for UART and unregulated power.

Wires on the block diagram indicate the direction and also the type of signal being transmitted. Dashed lines are power, and solid lines are PCB footprints. 

Block diagrams are a necessity for not only planning of the PCB but also the design.
