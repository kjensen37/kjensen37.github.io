## Overview
Below is the block diagram for my subsystem for Team 201. My diagram contains an ESP32, a temperature sensor, and debugging LEDs. Information and power are distributed between team members in the daisy chain format. The board will receive power through a barrel jack or another team members board which is all regulated by a 3.3V power switching supply. The connectors have a wire decdicated for UART and unregulated power.
