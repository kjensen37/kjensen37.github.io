## Module Requirements
The following sections document the requirements of this module. I was assigned the role of having a simple sensor, then being a floater to assist other teammates. On my PCB I will be using a temperature sensor. The goal of the temperature sensor is to be able to record changes in ambient water temperatures. This table contains the basic requirements, these being a microcontroller, power, and connectors to send information to teammates' boards.

| **Requirement Description** | **Measure of<br> Threshold** | **Target<br>Measure** |**Stretch<br>Requirement<br>(Y-N)**|
|-----------------------------| ----------------- | ----------------- | :-----: |
| Surface mounted, 3.3V switching power regulatore | 3.2 Volts | 3.3 Volts | No |
| Surface mounted microcontroller | 1 PIC or ESP | 8-bit PIC | No |
| Connection to recieve power | Barrel jack or other connector| Able to power PCB from a teamates board  | No |
| Temperature Sensor | Basic ambient temperature sensor | Ability to measure and record temperatures | No |
| Debugging LED's | LED's | Sufficient debugging LED's to improve quality of life when fixing the board | No |
